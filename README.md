This source variant is using data from the US500 (S&P) Index, and this data will be updated periodically.

Multilayer Perceptron Model
The first network that we will evaluate is a multilayer Perceptron, or MLP for short.

Convolutional Neural Network Model
Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are a type of neural network developed for two-dimensional image data, although they can     be used for one-dimensional data such as sequences of text and time series.
