This source variant is using data from the US500 (S&P) Index, and this data will be updated periodically.

Multilayer Perceptron Model:
The first network that we will evaluate is a multilayer Perceptron, or MLP for short.

Convolutional Neural Network Model:
Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are a type of neural network developed for two-dimensional image data, although they can     be used for one-dimensional data such as sequences of text and time series.

Recurrent Neural Network Models:
Recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, are those types of neural networks that use an output of the network from a prior step as an input in attempt to automatically learn across sequence data.

LSTM:
The LSTM neural network can be used for univariate time series forecasting.

CNN LSTM:
We have seen that the CNN model is capable of automatically learning and extracting features from the raw sequence data without scaling or differencing.

ConvLSTM:
It is possible to perform a convolutional operation as part of the read of the input sequence within each LSTM unit.
